{"text": " Aerial roots of Ficus elastica being formed into a bridge in Meghalaya, India\nIn parts of India, people guide the roots of the tree over chasms to eventually form living bridges.[4]\n\nOrnamental[edit]\nThis section does not cite any sources.

(November 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nFicus elastica is grown around the world as an ornamental plant, outside in frost-free climates (though it also tolerates light frosts) from the tropical to the Mediterranean and inside in colder climates as a houseplant. Although it is grown in Hawaii, the species of fig wasp required to allow it to spread naturally is not present there.\n\nMost cultivated plants are produced by vegetative propagation. This can be done by cuttings or by layering.\n\nAll parts of the plant contain an abundant milky white latex, which has been tested for use in the manufacture of rubber, but without economic and technical results; commercial rubber is actually produced from the sap of the Hevea brasiliensis.\n\nIn cultivation, it prefers bright sunlight but not hot temperatures. It has a high tolerance for drought, but prefers humidity and thrives in wet, tropical conditions. Ornamental hybrids (such as Robusta) have been derived from Ficus elastica with broader, stiffer and more upright leaves than the wild form. Many such hybrids exist, often with variegated leaves.\n\nLatex[edit]\nFicus elastica yields a milky white latex, a chemical compound separate from its sap and carried and stored in different cells. This latex was formerly used to make rubber,[2] but it should not be confused with the Par\u00e1 rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), the main commercial source of latex for rubber making. Just as with Hevea brasiliensis, the latex of Ficus elastica is an irritant to the eyes and skin and is toxic if taken internally.[5]\n\n"}
