(February 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nAlocasia are tropical plants that are increasingly becoming popular as houseplants.[4] The hybrid A. \u00d7 amazonica has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[5] They are typically grown as pot plants, but a better way is to grow the plants permanently in the controlled conditions of a greenhouse. They can tolerate dim light and cannot withstand direct sunlight. They should be cared for as any other tropical plant with weekly cleaning of the leaves, frequent fertilization  and medium to high humidity.[6]\n\nThey rarely survive cold winters or the dryness of artificial heating, but an attempt to slowly acclimatize plants from the summer garden to the house can help.[7] Once inside, the watering period must be reduced and the plants should be protected from spider mites or red spider attack.\n\n"}
